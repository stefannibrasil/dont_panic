  "\"something almost, but not quite entirely unlike tea\"",
  "\"The deep roar of the ocean.The break of waves on farther shores that thought can find.The silent thunders of the deep.And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming trillings, wordlings, and half-articulated songs of thought.Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the inarticulate, words breaking together.A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth.Waves of joy on--where? A world indescribably found, indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water.A fugue of voices now, clamoring explanations, of a disaster unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words.And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the fight. A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins gone.Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear.\"This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the Humans. We bid you farewell.\"And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly gray bodies rolling away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling.\"",
  "\"Fifteen years was a long time to be stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mind-boggingly dull as Earth.\"",
  "\"They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident.\"",
  "\"I'd far rather be happy than right any day.\"\"And are you?\" \"No. That's where it all falls down, of course.\"\"Pity\", said Arthur. \"It sounded like rather a good lifestyle otherwise.\"",
  "\"The Encyclopedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as \"Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun to Be With. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing devision of the Sirius Cybernetic Corporation as \"a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes,\"",
  "\"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my life-style\"",
  "\"Forty-two!\" yelled Loonquawl. \"Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work?\" \"I checked it very thoroughly,\" said the computer, \"and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is.\"",
  "\"If somebody thinks they're a hedgehog, presumably you just give 'em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves.\"",
  "\"Ghastly,\" continued Marvin, \"it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't even talk about it. Look at this door,\" he said, stepping through it. The irony circuits cut in to his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure. \" 'All the doors in his spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.' \" As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sighlike quality to it. \"Hummmmmmmyummmmmmmah!\" it said.\"",
  "\"Ford looked at him severely.And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dent's house whilst he's away, alright?\" he said.The mere thought,\" growled Mr Prosser, \"hadn't even begun to speculate,\" he continued, settling himself back, \"about the merest possibility of crossing my mind.\"",
  "\"A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason.This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.\"",
  "\"Hey, this is terrific!\" he said. \"Someone down there is trying to kill us!\"\"Terrific,\" said Arthur.\"But don't you see what this means?\"\"Yes. We are going to die.\"\"Yes, but apart from that.\"\"Apart from that?!\"\"It means we must be on to something!\"\"How soon can we get off it?\"",
  "\"There was a terribly ghastly silence.There was a terribly ghastly noise.There was a terribly ghastly silence.\"",
  "\"Perhaps I'm old and tired, but I think that the chances of finding out what's actually going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say, \"Hang the sense of it,\" and keep yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy than right any day.\"",
  "\"The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill as ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious perversion of physics- as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules\"",
  "\"There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?\"",
  "\"Space,\" it says, \"is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space, listen...\"",
  "\"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons.\"",
  "\"Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by striding purposefully.\"",
